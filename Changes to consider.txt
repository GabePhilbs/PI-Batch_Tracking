1- Group b should not have initial balance columns since they are 
    destination accounts and all balance comes from transfers   
2- This also means that the "transfers" column is useless, since its 
    amount will always be equa;l to "current balance"
3- Refund should also have cloth quantities, since the amount
     of cloths available can be reduced by a refund.
